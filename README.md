This is the final project of CS5001. I chose to create a music player app 
that reflects the content I learned in this course.

|--test_music_player.py: this file contains all the tests for MainApp class
|--audio: this folder contains all the music
|--pic: this folder contains png images for buttons and a snapshot of the app
```
